# The project explains about the marketing dataset detailing about the marketing campaigns to derive data-driven insights.
# Using Kaggle's dataset, prediction and clustering models were created to increase client response rates in marketing campaigns.  
# To find important variables like income and spending, preprocessed data, engineered features, and exploratory analysis were carried out.  
# 87.48% accuracy with KNN and 86.72% with Random Forest were achieved; four actionable clusters of consumers were identified.
